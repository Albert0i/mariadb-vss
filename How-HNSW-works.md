### How HNSW works? (by copilot)

Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) is a graph-based algorithm designed for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:


#### I. Overview
HNSW constructs a multi-layered graph where each layer represents a simplified, navigable network of connections. This hierarchical structure allows for quick and accurate searches even in large, high-dimensional datasets[1](https://www.datastax.com/guides/hierarchical-navigable-small-worlds)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world).

In Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW), the number of data nodes in each layer varies based on the structure of the graph:

##### Layer Structure
- **Top Layers**: The uppermost layers have fewer nodes and longer connections. These layers provide a broad overview and help in quickly navigating to the general vicinity of the nearest neighbors[1](https://www.datastax.com/guides/hierarchical-navigable-small-worlds)[2](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/hnsw/).
- **Bottom Layers**: The bottommost layer contains all the data nodes and has the shortest connections. This layer provides detailed and precise navigation to the nearest neighbors[3](https://zilliz.com/learn/hierarchical-navigable-small-worlds-HNSW).

##### Node Distribution
- **Upper Layers**: As you move up the layers, the number of nodes decreases. These layers act as a coarse filter, allowing the algorithm to skip large portions of the dataset quickly.
- **Bottom Layer**: The bottom layer includes all the data points, ensuring that the search can be refined to find the exact nearest neighbors.

##### Example
- **Layer 0 (Bottom Layer)**: Contains all the data nodes.
- **Layer 1**: Contains a subset of nodes from Layer 0.
- **Layer 2**: Contains an even smaller subset of nodes from Layer 1, and so on.

This hierarchical structure allows HNSW to efficiently balance between broad, fast navigation and detailed, accurate search.


#### II. Key Components
1. **Graph Structure**:
   - **Layers**: The graph consists of multiple layers, with each layer providing different levels of connectivity. The top layers have fewer connections, while the bottom layers have more detailed connections.
   - **Nodes and Edges**: Each node represents a data point, and edges represent connections between nodes. The number of connections per node is controlled by the parameter **M**.

2. **Construction Process**:
   - **efConstruction**: This parameter controls the size of the candidate list during graph construction, impacting the quality and efficiency of the graph[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world).
   - **Insertion**: When a new data point is added, it is inserted into the graph starting from the top layer. The algorithm navigates through the layers to find the best position for the new point, updating connections as needed.

3. **Search Process**:
   - **Entry Points**: The search starts at the top layer, using entry points to navigate through the graph.
   - **Navigable Shortcuts**: The hierarchical structure provides shortcuts that help quickly reach the nearest neighbors.
   - **efSearch**: This parameter controls the size of the priority queue during the search, affecting recall and speed[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world).


#### III, How It Works
1. **Initialization**: The algorithm begins by creating an initial graph with a few data points.
2. **Layer Construction**: As more data points are added, the graph is expanded layer by layer. Each new point is inserted starting from the top layer, navigating down to the appropriate level.
3. **Search**: To find the nearest neighbors of a query point, the algorithm starts at the top layer and uses the entry points to navigate through the graph. It uses the priority queue (controlled by efSearch) to keep track of the best candidates found so far.


#### IV. Advantages
- **Efficiency**: HNSW significantly reduces the time and computational resources needed for nearest neighbor searches.
- **Scalability**: It scales logarithmically, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
- **Accuracy**: Provides high recall and precision, essential for applications like recommendation systems, image recognition, and natural language processing[1](https://www.datastax.com/guides/hierarchical-navigable-small-worlds)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world).


#### V. Applications
HNSW is widely used in vector databases for tasks such as:
- **Image and Video Retrieval**: Finding similar images or videos.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting relevant items based on user preferences.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Searching for similar text embeddings[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world)[3](https://myscale.com/blog/hnsw-algorithm-exploration/).


#### VI. Impact of M and ef on Performance
##### 1. **M (Maximum Connections per Node)**
- **Definition**: M determines the maximum number of edges each node can have in the graph layers.
- **Impact**:
  - **Higher M**: Increases the density of connections, improving search efficiency and recall because there are more paths to traverse the graph.
  - **Lower M**: Reduces the index size and build time but may decrease recall and search efficiency[2](https://zilliz.com/ai-faq/what-are-the-key-configuration-parameters-for-an-hnsw-index-such-as-m-and-efconstructionefsearch-and-how-does-each-influence-the-tradeoff-between-index-size-build-time-query-speed-and-recall).
- **Trade-offs**: A higher M value means better search performance but at the cost of increased memory usage and longer build times[2](https://zilliz.com/ai-faq/what-are-the-key-configuration-parameters-for-an-hnsw-index-such-as-m-and-efconstructionefsearch-and-how-does-each-influence-the-tradeoff-between-index-size-build-time-query-speed-and-recall).

##### 2. **ef (efConstruction and efSearch)**
- **efConstruction**:
  - **Definition**: Controls the size of the candidate list used during the index construction phase.
  - **Impact**:
    - **Higher efConstruction**: Leads to a more optimized graph structure, improving recall and query speed.
    - **Lower efConstruction**: Reduces build time but may result in a less optimized graph[2](https://zilliz.com/ai-faq/what-are-the-key-configuration-parameters-for-an-hnsw-index-such-as-m-and-efconstructionefsearch-and-how-does-each-influence-the-tradeoff-between-index-size-build-time-query-speed-and-recall).
  - **Trade-offs**: Higher efConstruction values improve the quality of the graph but significantly increase the build time[2](https://zilliz.com/ai-faq/what-are-the-key-configuration-parameters-for-an-hnsw-index-such-as-m-and-efconstructionefsearch-and-how-does-each-influence-the-tradeoff-between-index-size-build-time-query-speed-and-recall).

- **efSearch**:
  - **Definition**: Determines the size of the priority queue maintained during search queries.
  - **Impact**:
    - **Higher efSearch**: Increases recall by considering more candidates, reducing the chance of missing true neighbors.
    - **Lower efSearch**: Improves query speed but may reduce recall[2](https://zilliz.com/ai-faq/what-are-the-key-configuration-parameters-for-an-hnsw-index-such-as-m-and-efconstructionefsearch-and-how-does-each-influence-the-tradeoff-between-index-size-build-time-query-speed-and-recall).
  - **Trade-offs**: Higher efSearch values enhance recall but at the cost of slower query speeds[2](https://zilliz.com/ai-faq/what-are-the-key-configuration-parameters-for-an-hnsw-index-such-as-m-and-efconstructionefsearch-and-how-does-each-influence-the-tradeoff-between-index-size-build-time-query-speed-and-recall).


##### 3. Practical Example
For a recommendation system requiring high recall, you might set:
- **M = 24**
- **efConstruction = 400**
- **efSearch = 200**

This configuration would yield a large, well-optimized index with slower build times but accurate results. Conversely, for real-time applications, you might set:
- **M = 12**
- **efConstruction = 100**
- **efSearch = 50**

This would reduce memory usage and latency at the cost of lower recall[2](https://zilliz.com/ai-faq/what-are-the-key-configuration-parameters-for-an-hnsw-index-such-as-m-and-efconstructionefsearch-and-how-does-each-influence-the-tradeoff-between-index-size-build-time-query-speed-and-recall).
