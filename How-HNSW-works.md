### How HNSW works? 

Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) is a graph-based algorithm designed for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

#### Overview
HNSW constructs a multi-layered graph where each layer represents a simplified, navigable network of connections. This hierarchical structure allows for quick and accurate searches even in large, high-dimensional datasets[1](https://www.datastax.com/guides/hierarchical-navigable-small-worlds)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world).

#### Key Components
1. **Graph Structure**:
   - **Layers**: The graph consists of multiple layers, with each layer providing different levels of connectivity. The top layers have fewer connections, while the bottom layers have more detailed connections.
   - **Nodes and Edges**: Each node represents a data point, and edges represent connections between nodes. The number of connections per node is controlled by the parameter **M**.

2. **Construction Process**:
   - **efConstruction**: This parameter controls the size of the candidate list during graph construction, impacting the quality and efficiency of the graph[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world).
   - **Insertion**: When a new data point is added, it is inserted into the graph starting from the top layer. The algorithm navigates through the layers to find the best position for the new point, updating connections as needed.

3. **Search Process**:
   - **Entry Points**: The search starts at the top layer, using entry points to navigate through the graph.
   - **Navigable Shortcuts**: The hierarchical structure provides shortcuts that help quickly reach the nearest neighbors.
   - **efSearch**: This parameter controls the size of the priority queue during the search, affecting recall and speed[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world).

### How It Works
1. **Initialization**: The algorithm begins by creating an initial graph with a few data points.
2. **Layer Construction**: As more data points are added, the graph is expanded layer by layer. Each new point is inserted starting from the top layer, navigating down to the appropriate level.
3. **Search**: To find the nearest neighbors of a query point, the algorithm starts at the top layer and uses the entry points to navigate through the graph. It uses the priority queue (controlled by efSearch) to keep track of the best candidates found so far.

#### Advantages
- **Efficiency**: HNSW significantly reduces the time and computational resources needed for nearest neighbor searches.
- **Scalability**: It scales logarithmically, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
- **Accuracy**: Provides high recall and precision, essential for applications like recommendation systems, image recognition, and natural language processing[1](https://www.datastax.com/guides/hierarchical-navigable-small-worlds)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world).

#### Applications
HNSW is widely used in vector databases for tasks such as:
- **Image and Video Retrieval**: Finding similar images or videos.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting relevant items based on user preferences.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Searching for similar text embeddings[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world)[3](https://myscale.com/blog/hnsw-algorithm-exploration/).
